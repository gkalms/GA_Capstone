# GA_Capstone
General Capstone project April 2021

My idea:
Build a simple website to provide information and a booking enquiry service for guests. My father's motel in Nakuru, Kenya


-	To be Information only website
-	CRUD will be represented by 1: guest creating booking enquiry; admin updating or deleting Booking enquiry information

Look and feel I want to achieve:
One page website: https://clhg.com/hotels/901/Fairview-Hotel-Nairobi

User storie:
As Guest I want information on Room and board
As Guest, I want to make a booking enquiry
As Hotel manager I want to view, update or delete booking enquiry information

Database:
2 tables:
Employee - Name, password 
Enquiry - Guest name, phone,email, Room type, Boarding type, Number of guests, arrival and departure Dates

Wireframe: Attach image
