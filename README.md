# GA_Capstone
General Capstone project April 2021

My idea:
Build a website presence for my father’s second hotel – Hote Eel

-	To be Information only website
-	CRUD will be represented by admin updating website content – Room/Board description and rates
-	For capstone project – No booking functionality; Customer will still ring to book
-	Option:  Link up to Booking.com?/Fill out form that is emailed in?/????

Look and feel I want to achieve:
One page website: https://clhg.com/hotels/901/Fairview-Hotel-Nairobi

User story
As Guest I want information on Room and board
As Hotel manager I want to update listings of rooms/board information
